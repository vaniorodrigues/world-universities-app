# South America Universities App

## About 

This mobile app was developed using Flutter. 
It was 3 pages, the first one contains a list of every country in South America. By selecting a country, the app will load a list of the universities of said country from a public API (http://universities.hipolab.com/), in a second page. Once loaded, the list is locally saved in the device.
Selecting a university will load a third page, where all the information available at the public API for the university will be displayed. It also has a favorite button which also is locally stored when the app closes.
